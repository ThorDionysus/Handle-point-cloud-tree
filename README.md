# Point Cloud Tree Segmentation and Tree Phenotype Retrieval Program
## Introduction
This project is intended to handle the point cloud data of trees. It can preform some basic funcioon,among which are point cloud segmentation, point cloud merging and basic phenotype retrival.This project is only appropritate to PLY files. Before using this series of codes, make sure you have already downloaded
