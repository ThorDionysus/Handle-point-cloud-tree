# Point Cloud Tree Segmentation and Tree Phenotype Retrieval Program
## Introduction
This project is intended to handle the point cloud data of trees. It can preform some basic funcioon,among which are point cloud segmentation, point cloud merging and basic phenotype retrival.This project is only appropritate to PLY files. Before using this series of codes, make sure you have already downloaded the floolwing package and library:
### open3d: You can install it using pip with the following command:
~~~ pip install open3d
### NumPy: If you don't already have NumPy installed, you can install it with:
~~~ pip install numpy
### scikit-learn (sklearn): You can install scikit-learn with:
~~~ pip install scikit-learn
Make sure you have these packages installed in your Python environment before running the code. Also, ensure that you have a valid point cloud file at the specified "file_path" or replace it with the actual path to the point cloud you want to work with.
